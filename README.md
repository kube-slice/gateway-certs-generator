# gateway-certs-generator

`This is an opinionated single-file OpenVPN TLS certificate configuration generator for slice gateways. it is an enhancement to easy-rsa (typically bundled with OpenVPN).`

`easy-rsa is a CLI utility to build and manage a PKI CA. In laymen's terms, this means to create a root certificate authority, and request and sign certificates, including intermediate CAs and certificate revocation lists (CRL).`
